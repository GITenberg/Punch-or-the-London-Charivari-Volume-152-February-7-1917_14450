<h3>CHARIVARIA.</h3>

  <p>To celebrate his birthday, the KAISER arranged a theatrical
  performance, entitled <i>The German Blacksmith</i>, of which he was part
  author. It is not yet known in what way his people had offended him.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is feared that we have sadly misjudged Greece. They have saluted
  the Entente flags, and it is rumoured that KING CONSTANTINE is even
  prepared to put out his tongue at the KAISER.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Chancellor BETHMANN-HOLLWEG has been accused by the Junker Press of
  selling his countrymen to the Allies. But, to judge from the latest
  German Note to America, the fact appears to be that he has simply given
  them away.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>As the result of the cold snap, wild boars have made their appearance
  in Northern France. Numbers have already been killed, and it is reported
  that the KAISER has agreed with an American syndicate to be filmed in the
  <i>rôle</i> of their destroyer, the proceeds to be devoted to the
  furtherance of the league to enforce peace.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Many German soldiers have, according to the Hamburg
  <i>Fremdenblatt</i>, received slips of pasteboard inscribed, "Soldiers of
  the Fatherland, fight on!" It is rumoured that several of the soldiers
  have written across the cards, "Fight on what?"</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>After the 22nd of February, all enemy aliens engaged in business in
  this country will be obliged to trade in their own names. With a few
  honourable exceptions, like the great Frankfurt house of Wurst, our alien
  business men have sedulously concealed their identity.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The patriotic Coroner for East Essex, who has erected a pig-sty in the
  middle of his choice rose-garden, informs us that Frau Karl Druschki has
  already thrown out some nice strong suckers.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Cheddar cheese," says a news item, "is 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a pound
  in Norwich." But what the public are clamouring to know is the price of
  Wensleydale cheese in Ilfracombe.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The American gentleman who caused so much commotion in a London hotel,
  the other day, by his impatience at dinner must, after all, be excused.
  It appears the poor fellow was anxious to get through with his meal
  before a new Government department commandeered the place.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The SPEAKER'S Electoral Reform Committee recommends that Candidates'
  expenses shall not exceed 4<i>d.</i> per elector in three-member
  boroughs, and several political agents have written to point out that it
  cannot possibly be done in view of the recent increase in the price of
  beer.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Shirley Park (Croydon) Golf Club has decided to reduce the course
  from 18 holes to 9; but a suggestion that the half-course thus saved
  should be added to the Club luncheon has met with an emphatic refusal
  from the FOOD CONTROLLER.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A farmer in the Weald of Kent is offering 13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
  week, board and lodging not provided, to a horseman willing to work
  fifteen hours a day. It is understood that this insidious attempt to
  popularise agriculture at the expense of the army has been the subject of
  a heated interchange of letters between the War Office and the Board of
  Agriculture.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The warmest places in England yesterday," says <i>The Pall Mall
  Gazette</i>, "were Scotland and the South-West of England." We have got
  into trouble before now with our Caledonian purists for speaking of Great
  Britain as England, but we never said a thing like that.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A London doctor, says <i>The Daily Mail</i>, estimates that colds cost
  this country £15,000,000 annually. If that is the case we may say at once
  that we think the charge is excessive.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A gossip-writer makes much of the fact that he saw a telegraph
  messenger running in Shoe Lane the other morning. We are glad to be in a
  position to clear up this mystery. It appears that the messenger in
  question was in the act of going off duty.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>There seems to be no intention of issuing sugar tickets&mdash;until a
  suitable palace can be obtained for the accommodation of the functionary
  responsible for this feature.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The charge for cleaning white gloves has been increased, and it is
  likely that there will be a return to the piebald evening wear so much in
  vogue in Soho restaurants.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The 1917 pennies appear to be thinner than those of pre-War issues,
  and several maiden ladies have written to the authorities asking if
  income tax has been deducted at the source.</p>

  <blockquote>"Residents early astir on Sunday morning had an unpleasant

  glassy ice, which made walking impossible without some assistance. A

  avail."&mdash;<i>Oxford Times</i>.</blockquote>

  <p>That was our own experience with a walking-stick which was absolutely
  bootless.</p>

<h3>THE MUD-LARKS.</h3>

  <p>Our mess was situated on the crest of a ridge, and enjoyed an
  uninterrupted view of rolling leagues of mud; it had the appearance of a
  packing-case floating on an ocean of ooze.</p>

  <p>We and our servants, and our rats and our cockroaches, and our other
  bosom-companions slept in tents pitched round and about the mess.</p>

  <p>The whole camp was connected with the outer world by a pathway of
  ammunition boxes, laid stepping-stone-wise; we went to and fro, lepping
  from box to box as leps the chamois from Alp to Alp. Should you miss your
  lep there would be a swirl of mud, a gulping noise, and that was the end
  of you; your sorrowing comrades shed a little chloride of lime over the
  spot where you were last seen, posted you as "Believed missing" and
  indented for another Second-Lieutenant (or Field-Marshal, as the case
  might be).</p>

  <p>Our mess was constructed of loosely piled shell boxes, and roofed by a
  tin lid. We stole the ingredients box by box, and erected the house with
  our own fair hands, so we loved it with parental love; but it had its
  little drawbacks. Whenever the field guns in our neighbourhood did any
  business, the tin lid rattled madly and the shell boxes jostled each
  other all over the place. It was quite possible to leave our mess at peep
  o'day severely Gothic in design, and to return at dewy eve to find it
  rakishly Rococo.</p>

  <p>William, our Transport Officer and Mess President, was everlastingly
  piping all hands on deck at unseemly hours to save the home and push it
  back into shape; we were householders in the fullest sense of the
  term.</p>

  <p>Before the War, William assures us, he was a bright young thing, full
  of merry quips and jolly practical jokes, the life and soul of any party,
  but what with the contortions of the mess and the vagaries of the
  transport mules he had become a saddened man.</p>

  <p>Between them&mdash;the mules and the mess&mdash;he never got a whole
  night in bod; either the mules were having bad dreams, sleep-walking into
  strange lines and getting themselves abhorred, or the field guns were on
  the job and the mess had the jumps. If Hans, the Hun, had not been the
  perfect little gentleman he is, and had dropped a shell anywhere near us
  (instead of assiduously spraying a distant ridge where nobody ever was,
  is, or will be) our mess would have been with Tyre and Sidon; but Hans
  never forgot himself for a moment; it was our own side we distrusted. The
  Heavies, for instance. The Heavies warped themselves laboriously into
  position behind our hill, disguised themselves as gooseberry bushes, and
  gave an impression of the crack of doom at 2 A.M. one snowy morning.</p>

  <p>Our mess immediately broke out into St. Vitus's dance, and William
  piped all hands on deck.</p>

  <p>The Skipper, picturesquely clad in boots (gum, high) and a goat's
  skin, flung himself on the east wing, and became an animated buttress.
  Albert Edward climbed aloft and sat on the tin lid, which was opening and
  shutting at every pore. Mactavish put his shoulder to the south wall to
  keep it from working round to the north. I clung to the pantry, which was
  coming adrift from its parent stem, while William ran about everywhere,
  giving advice and falling over things. The mess passed rapidly through
  every style of architecture, from a Chinese pagoda to a Swiss châlet, and
  was on the point of confusing itself with a Spanish castle when the
  Heavies switched off their hate and went to bed. And not a second too
  soon. Another moment and I should have dropped the pantry, Albert Edward
  would have been sea-sick, and the Skipper would have let the east wing go
  west.</p>

  <p>We pushed the mess back into shape, and went inside it for a peg of
  something and a consultation. Next evening William called on the Heavies'
  commander and decoyed him up to dine. We regaled him with wassail and
  gramophone and explained the situation to him. The Lord of the Heavies, a
  charming fellow, nearly burst into tears when he heard of the ill he had
  unwittingly done us, and was led home by William at 1.30 A.M., swearing
  to withdraw his infernal machines, or beat them into ploughshares, the
  very next day. The very next night our mess, without any sort of
  preliminary warning, lost its balance, sat down with a crash, and lay
  littered about a quarter of an acre of ground. We all turned out and
  miserably surveyed the ruins. What had done it? We couldn't guess. The
  field guns had gone to bye-bye, the Heavies had gone elsewhere. Hans, the
  Hun, couldn't have made a mistake and shelled us? Never! It was a
  mystery; so we all lifted up our voices and wailed for William. He was
  Mess President; it was his fault, of course.</p>

  <p>At that moment William hove out of the night, driving his tent before
  him by bashing it with a mallet.</p>

  <p>According to William there was one, "Sunny Jim," a morbid transport
  mule, inside the tent, providing the motive power. "Sunny Jim" had always
  been something of a somnambulist, and this time he had sleep-walked clean
  through our mess and on into William's tent, where the mallet woke him
  up. He was then making the best of his way home to lines again, expedited
  by William and the mallet.</p>

  <p>So now we are messless; now we crouch shivering in tents and talk
  lovingly of the good old times beneath our good old tin roof-tree, of the
  wonderful view of the mud we used to get from our window, and of the
  homely tune our shell-boxes used to perform as they jostled together of a
  stormy night.</p>

  <p>And sometimes, as we crouch shivering in our tents, we hear a strange
  sound stealing up-hill from the lines. It is the mules laughing.</p>

<h3>LETTERS FROM MACEDONIA.</h3>

<p class="center">IV.</p>

  <p>MY DEAR JERRY,&mdash;I am writing this from my position on top of a
  small hill, while my devoted band of followers sits round me and waits
  for me to speak. I always sit here, because if I wanted to go somewhere
  else I should have to climb down this hill and then up another one. I
  hate hills. So does the devoted band.</p>

  <p>Behind another little hill a hundred yards away we believe there lurks
  an army corps of Bulgars, but we are afraid to look and see. Instead, we
  fix and unfix bayonets every ten minutes and make martial noises. This,
  we hope, affects the enemy's <i>moral</i>, and having your <i>moral</i>
  affected every ten minutes is no joke, I can tell you.</p>

  <p>The spirit of our troops remains excellent. You can see that this is
  true from the fact that my joke still works. Every night for the last
  three months, while administering quinine to my army, I have exhorted
  them not to be greedy and not to take too much. They still laugh
  heartily, nay uproariously. We are a wonderful nation.</p>

  <p>Our chief source of combined instruction and amusement is still the
  antheap beside us, and in this connection, Jeremiah, I must introduce to
  you Herbert, a young officer in the ant A.S.C.</p>

  <p>When we first knew Herbert (or "'Erb" as he was known in those days),
  he was an impudent and pushful private. When his corps were engaged in
  removing the larger pieces of straw out of their hole in the hill, many a
  time I have seen him staggering manfully towards the entrance with an
  enormous piece on his slender shoulders, against the tide of his
  comrades; for he never could resist the temptation to replace the really
  big stalks in the hole. As he knocked against one and another the older
  ants would step aside, lay down their loads, and expostulate with him,
  always ending by giving him a good clip on the ear; but 'Erb was never
  dismayed.</p>

  <p>Now and again, during a temporary slackness in the stream, he would
  disappear triumphantly into the hole, his log trailing behind him; but
  his triumph was always short-lived. I would seem to hear a scuffle and
  two bumps, and 'Erb would shoot gracefully upwards, followed by his
  burden, and fall in a heap beside the door. However, as soon as he
  recovered he would try again. On one sultry afternoon I noticed he
  succeeded in effecting an entrance after twenty-three successive
  chuck-outs.</p>

  <p>His persistence piqued my curiosity. I wondered why he should so
  obstinately try to do a thing which was obviously distasteful to all his
  seniors. And then, yesterday, there was a change.</p>

  <p>'Erb was resting after his eighth chuck-out under a plank when a
  venerable ant, heavy with the accumulated wisdom and weakness of years,
  approached the exit from within and tried to get out, but in vain. He
  swore and struggled in a futile sort of way, while his attendant
  subordinates stood about helplessly. 'Erb saw his opportunity. He seized
  his plank, dashed forward&mdash;you may not believe me, Jerry, but it is
  the gospel truth&mdash;saluted smartly, and laid down his plank as a sort
  of ladder. Supporting himself upon it the veteran crawled out. Then he
  spoke to 'Erb, and I think I saw him asking someone the lad's name.</p>

  <p>That is why Second Lieutenant Herbert is to-day in charge of a working
  party. He is now engaged in clipping the ear of a larger ant. I imagine
  there must have been some lack of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
  id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> discipline. Possibly his inferior had
  addressed him as "Erb."</p>

  <p>Well, all our prospects are pleasing and only Bulgar vile. I must now
  make a martial noise, so <i>au revoir.</i></p>

<h3>A TALE OF A COINCIDENCE.</h3>

  <p>"Coincidences," said the ordinary seaman, "are rum things. Now I can
  tell you of a rum un that happened to me."</p>

  <p>It said Royal Naval Reserve round his cap, but he looked as if he
  ought to be wearing gold earrings and a gaudy handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"When I was a young feller I made a voyage or two in an old hooker
  called the <i>Pearl of Asia</i>. Her old man at that time was old Captain
  Gillson, him that had the gold tooth an' the swell ma'ogany fist in place
  o' the one that got blowed off by a rocket in Falmouth Roads. Well, I was
  walkin' out with a young woman at Liverpool&mdash;nice young
  thing&mdash;an' she give me a ring to keep to remember 'er by, the day
  before we sailed. Nice thing it was; it had 'Mizpah' wrote on it.</p>

  <p>"We 'ad two or three fellers in the crowd for'ard that voyage as would
  'andle anything as wasn't too 'ot or too 'eavy which explains why I got
  into a 'abit of slippin' my bits o' vallybles, such as joolery, into a
  bit of a cache I found all nice and 'andy in the planking' back o' my
  bunk.</p>

  <p>"We 'ad a long passage of it 'ome, a 'undred-and-sixty days from
  Portland, Oregon, to London River, an' what with thinkin' of the thumpin'
  lump o' pay I'd have to draw an' one thing an' another, I clean forgot
  all about the ring I'd left cached in the little place back o' my bunk
  yonder.</p>

  <p>"Well, I drew my pay all right, and after a bit I tramped it to
  Liverpool, to look out for another ship. An' the first person I met in
  Liverpool was the young woman I 'ad the ring of.</p>

  <p>"'Where's my ring?' she says, before I'd time to look round.</p>

  <p>"Now, I never was one as liked 'avin' words with a woman, so I pitched
  her a nice yarn about the cache I 'ad at the back o' my bunk, an' 'ow I
  vallied 'er ring that 'igh I stowed it there to keep it safe, an' 'ow I'd
  slid down the anchor cable an' swum ashore an' left everything I 'ad
  behind me, I was that red-'ot for a sight of 'er.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span>

  <p>"'Ye didn't,' she says quite ratty, 'ye gave it to one o' them nasty
  yaller gals ye sing about.'</p>

  <p>"'I didn't,' I says; 'Ye did,' she says; 'I didn't,' says I. An' we
  went on like that for a bit until I says at last, 'If I can get aboard
  the old <i>Pearl</i> again,' I says, 'I'll get the ring,' I says, 'an'
  send it you in a letter,' I says, 'an' then per'aps you'll be sorry for
  the nasty way you've spoke to me,' I says.</p>

  <p>"'Ho, yes,' she says, sniffy-like, 'per'aps I will, per'aps I won't,'
  an' off she goes with 'er nose in the air.</p>

  <p>"My next ship was for Frisco to load grain; and I made sure of
  droppin' acrost the <i>Pearl</i> there, for she was bound the same way.
  But I never did. She was dismasted in the South Pacific on the outward
  passage, and had to put in to one of them Chile ports for repairs. So she
  never got to Frisco until after we sailed for 'ome. An' that was the way
  it went on. She kep' dodgin' me all over the seven seas, an' the nearest
  I got to 'er was when we give 'er a cheer off Sydney Heads, outward
  bound, when we was just pickin' up our pilot. The last I 'eard of 'er
  after that was from a feller that 'ad seen 'er knockin' round the South
  Pacific, sailin' out o' Carrizal or Antofagasta or one o' them places. I
  was in the Western Ocean mail-boat service at the time, and so o' course
  she was off my run altogether.</p>

  <p>"I was still in the same mail-boat when she give up the passenger
  business an' went on the North Sea patrol.</p>

  <p>"Well, one day we boarded a Chile barque in the ordinary course o'
  duty, and I was one o' those as went on board with the lootenant. They
  generally takes me on them jobs, the reason bein' that I know a deal o'
  foreign languages. I don't believe there's a country in the world where I
  couldn't make myself understood, partic'lar when I'm wantin' a drink
  bad.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't takin' that much notice of this 'ere ship at the time (there
  was a bit of a nasty jobble on the water, for one thing, and we 'ad our
  work cut out gettin' alongside), except that 'er name was the <i>Maria de
  Somethink-or-other</i>&mdash;some Dago name. But while we was waitin' for
  the lootenant to finish 'is business with Old Monkey Brand, which was the
  black-faced Chileno captain she 'ad, it come over me all of a
  suddent.</p>

  <p>"'Strike me pink!' I says, 'may my name be Dennis if I 'aven't seen
  that there bit o' fancy-work on the poop ladder rails before;' which so I
  'ad, for I done it myself in the doldrums, an' a nice bit o' work it was,
  too.</p>

  <p>"You'll 'ave guessed by now that she was none other than the <i>Pearl
  of Asia</i>; an' no wonder I 'adn't reckernised 'er, what with the mess
  she was in alow and aloft, an' allyminian paint all over the poop
  railin's as would 'ave made our old blue-nose mate die o' rage.</p>

  <p>"'You carry on 'ere,' I says to the feller that was with me; 'I'm
  goin' for'ard a minute.'</p>

  <p>"'Arf a minute, an' I was in my old bunk; an' there was the cache all
  right, just like I left it."</p>

  <p>He paused dramatically; I supposed it was for histrionic effect, but
  it lasted so long that I said, "And so I suppose you sent the ring to the
  girl after all?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! '<i>er!</i>" he said, with an air of surprise, "I've forgot 'er
  name and all about 'er, only that she 'ad a brother in one o' them
  monkey-boats of ELDER DEMPSTER'S&mdash;'e 'ad the biggest thirst I ever
  struck."</p>

  <p>"But the ring?" I said. "I suppose it was there all right?"</p>

  <p>He stopped his pipe down with his thumb, with an enigmatical
  expression.</p>

  <p>"That's where the bloomin' coincidence come in," he said; "it
  weren't."</p>

      <p>Far other than the frenzied yaps</p>

      <p>Shared with thy face my frugal ration,</p>
      <p>Squandered my balance at the bank</p>
      <p>When thou didst chew the postman's shank,</p>
      <p>And gone in debt replacing stocks</p>
      <p>Of private cats and Plymouth Rocks.</p>
      <p>And, when they claimed the annual fee</p>
      <p>That seals the bond twixt thee and me,</p>
      <p>Against harsh Circumstance's edge</p>
      <p>Did I not put my fob in pledge</p>
      <p>And cheat the minions of excise</p>
      <p>Who otherwise had ta'en thee prize?</p>

      <p>And seek my feelings to assail</p>
      <p>With agitations of the tail.</p>
      <p>Yet are there beings lost to grace</p>
      <p>Who claim that thou art out of place,</p>
      <p>That when the dogs of war are loose</p>
      <p>Domestic kinds are void of use,</p>
      <p>And that a chicken or a hog</p>

<h3>TAXIS AND TALK.</h3>

  <p>Conversation in the streets of London has never been easy; not, at any
  rate, until the small hours, when the best of it is done. But it becomes
  even more complex when one of the talkers is pressed for time and wants a
  taxi, and disengaged taxis are as rare as new jokes in a revue.</p>

  <p>Let the following dialogue prove it. I leave open the question whether
  or not I have reported the real terms of our conversation, merely
  reminding you that two men together, removed from the frivolity of women,
  tend, even in the street and when the thermometer is below
  freezing-point, to a high seriousness rare when the sexes are
  mingled.</p>

  <p>Imagine us facing a wind from the east composed of steel filings and
  all uncharity. We are somewhere in Chelsea, and for some reason or other,
  or none at all, I am accompanying him.</p>

  <p><i>He</i> (<i>looking at his watch</i>). I've got to be at Grosvenor
  Gardens by half-past one and there's not a taxi anywhere. We must walk
  fast and perhaps we'll meet one. Dash this War anyhow. (<i>He said, as a
  matter of fact, "damn," but I am getting so tired of that word, in print
  that I shall employ alternatives every time. Someone really must
  institute a close season for "damns" or they won't any longer be funny on
  the stage; and, since to laugh in theatres has become a national duty,
  that, in the present state of the wit market, would be privation
  indeed.</i>)</p>

  <p><i>I</i> (<i>submerged by brain wave</i>). Perhaps we'll meet one.</p>

  <p><i>He.</i> Keep a sharp look out, won't you? I 've got to be there by
  half-past one, and I hate to be late.</p>

  <p><i>I.</i> Those tailors you were asking me about&mdash;I think you'll
  find them very decent people. They&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>He</i> (<i>excitedly</i>). Here comes one. Hi! Hi!</p>

  <blockquote>[<i>A taxi, obviously full of people, approaches and passes,
  the driver casting a pitying glance at my poor signalling
  friend.</i></blockquote>

  <p><i>He.</i> I thought it was free.</p>

  <p><i>I.</i> The flag was down.</p>

  <p><i>He.</i> I couldn't be sure. What were you saying? Sorry.</p>

  <p><i>I.</i> Oh, only about those tailors. If you really want to change,
  you know, I could&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>He.</i> Do you mind walking a little faster?</p>

  <p><i>I</i> (<i>mendaciously</i>). Not at all. I could give you my card,
  don't you know. But of course you might not like them. Tastes differ. To
  me they seem to be first-rate, as tailors go.</p>

  <p><i>He</i> (<i>profoundly&mdash;though he is not more profound than I
  am</i>). Of course, as tailors go.</p>

  <p><i>I.</i> They 're best at&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>He</i> (<i>excited again</i>). Here's another. Hi! Hi! Taxi. No,
  it's engaged.</p>

  <p><i>I</i> (<i>with a kind impulse</i>). If you'll ask me, I'll tell you
  whether the flags are up or not. I think I must be able to see farther
  than you.</p>

  <p><i>He.</i> Do.</p>

  <p><i>I.</i> I was always rather famous for long sight.
  It's&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>He (turning round)</i>). Isn't that one behind us? Is that
  free?</p>

  <p><i>I.</i> I can't tell yet.</p>

  <p><i>He.</i> Surely the flag's up.</p>

  <blockquote>[<i>He steps into the road and waves his
  stick.</i></blockquote>

  <p><i>I.</i> It's a private car.</p>

  <p><i>He.</i> Hang the thing! so it is. They <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span> ought to be painted white or
  something. Life is not worth living just now.</p>

  <p><i>I.</i> They're best for trousers, I should say. Their
  overcoats&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>He</i> (<i>pointing up side-street</i>). Isn't that one there? Hi,
  taxi! Good heavens, that other fellow's got it. We really must walk
  faster. If there isn't one on the rank in Sloane Square, I'm done. If
  there's one thing I hate it's being late. Besides, I'm blamed hungry.
  When I'm hungry I'm miserable till I eat. No good to anyone.</p>

  <p><i>I.</i> As I was saying&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>He.</i> What I want to know is, where are the taxis? They're not on
  the streets, anyway; then where are they? One never sees a yard full of
  them, but they must be somewhere. It's a scandal&mdash;a positive
  outrage.</p>

  <p><i>I.</i> Their overcoats can be very disappointing. I don't know how
  it is, but they don't seem to understand overcoats. But they're so good
  in other ways, you know, that really if you are
  thinking&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>He.</i> Here's one, really empty. Hi! Hi! Taxi! Hi! Hi!</p>

  <blockquote>[<i>The flag is up but the driver shakes his head, makes a
  noise which sounds like "dinner" and glides serenely on.</i></blockquote>

  <p><i>He.</i> Well, I'm blamed! Did you ever see anything like it? What's
  that he said?</p>

  <p><i>I.</i> It sounded like "dinner."</p>

  <p><i>He.</i> Dinner! Of all the something cheek! Dinner! What's the
  world coming to?</p>

  <p><i>I</i> (<i>brilliantly</i>). Perhaps he's hungry.</p>

  <p><i>He.</i> Hungry! Greedy, you mean. Hansom drivers never refused to
  take you because they were hungry. It's monstrous. Bless the War, anyway.
  (<i>Looking at his watch</i>) I say, we must put a spurt on. You don't
  mind, do you?</p>

  <p><i>I</i> (<i>more mendaciously, and wondering why I'm so weak</i>).
  Oh, no.</p>

  <blockquote>[<i>We both begin to scuttle, half run and half
  walk.</i></blockquote>

  <p><i>I</i> (<i>panting</i>). As I was saying, they're not A1 at
  overcoats, but they've a first-class cutter for everything else. Just
  tell me if you want to change and I'll introduce you, and then you'll get
  special treatment. There's nothing they wouldn't do for me.</p>

  <p><i>He</i> (<i>breathlessly</i>). Ah! There's the rank. There's just
  one cab there. How awful if it were to be taken before he saw us. Run
  like Heaven.</p>

  <p><i>I</i> (<i>running like Heaven</i>). I think I'll leave you
  here.</p>

  <p><i>He</i> (<i>running still more like Heaven, a little ahead</i>). Oh
  no, come on. I want to hear about those tailors. Hi! Hi! Wave your stick
  like Heaven!</p>

  <blockquote>[<i>We both wave our sticks like Heaven.</i></blockquote>

  <p><i>He</i> (<i>subsiding into a walk</i>). Ah! it's all right. He's
  seen us. (<i>Taking out his watch</i>) I've got four minutes. We shall
  just do it. Good-bye.</p>

  <blockquote>[<i>He leaps into the cab and I turn away wondering where I
  shall get lunch.</i></blockquote>

  <p><i>He</i> (<i>shouting from window</i>). Let me know about those
  tailors some day; if they're any good, you know.</p>

<h3>AT THE PLAY.</h3>

<p class="center">"ANTHONY IN WONDERLAND."</p>

  <p>It was not till about the middle of the play, and after a narcotic had
  been administered to him, that <i>Anthony</i> got there; but we were in
  Wonderland almost from the start, without the aid of drugs. For we were
  asked to believe that Mr. CHARLES HAWTREY was a visionary, amorous of an
  ideal which no earthly woman could realise for him. Occasionally he had
  caught a glimpse of it in the creations of Art&mdash;at the Tate Gallery
  or Madame TUSSAUD'S or the cinema; but in Bond Street never.</p>

  <p>And the pity of it was that he had come in for a fortune of seven
  hundred thousand pounds odd, which would pass elsewhere unless he married
  by a given date. It was therefore the clear duty of his relatives&mdash;a
  couple of sisters and their husbands&mdash;to find a wife for him. After
  vainly trying him with every pretty woman of their acquaintance they had
  resort, in desperation, to the black art of a certain <i>Mr. Mortimer
  John</i> (U.S.A.), an infallible inventor of stunts, who made a rapid
  diagnosis of the case and at once pronounced himself confident of
  success.</p>

  <p>Briefly&mdash;for it is a long and elaborate story&mdash;his scheme is
  to choose a charming girl, and make a film drama round her.
  <i>Anthony</i>, with family, is taken to see the show and occupies the
  best box in the Prince of Wales's Theatre, from which, after a little
  critical comment upon us in the audience, he falls in love with the
  heroine. It is the typical film of lurid life on a Californian ranch, and
  might almost have been modelled on one of Mr. Punch's cinema burlesques.
  There are the familiar scenes of a plot to hang the girl's lover, swiftly
  alternating with scenes of her progress on horseback through the primeval
  forest, and concluding with her arrival just in time to shoot the villain
  and untie the noose that encircles her lover's carotid.</p>

  <p>On the return of the party from the cinema, <i>Mortimer John</i>
  describes to <i>Anthony</i> the powers of a drug which induces the most
  vivid of dreams. He, <i>John</i>, had once been in <i>Anthony's</i>
  pitiful case, and through the services of this drug had achieved his
  quest of the ideal woman. <i>Anthony</i>, greatly intrigued, consents to
  swallow a sample of the potion. It is a simple narcotic, and under its
  influence he is conveyed, in a state of coma and a suitable change of
  apparel, into the heart of Surrey, where at sunrise he is restored to
  animation and has the scenes of the evening's drama re-enacted before his
  eyes, as originally filmed for exhibition. Under the impression that this
  is merely the vivid dream that he had been promised, he himself takes
  part in the living drama, playing the noble <i>rôle</i> of an
  exceptionally white man. In the course of it he exchanges pledges of
  eternal love with <i>Aloney</i> the heroine. Finally, in a spasm of
  heroic self-sacrifice, he takes poison with the alleged purpose of saving
  the heroine's life. We never quite gather how his suicide should serve
  this end, but then the whole atmosphere is charged with that obscurity
  which is the very breath of the film-drama.</p>

    <h4>AN IDYLL OF MOVIE-LAND.</h4>

    <p class="center"><i>Anthony Silvertree</i> MR. CHARLES HAWTREY.</p>

    <p class="center"><i>Aloney</i> MISS WINIFRED BARNES.</p>
  </div>
  <p>The poison is nothing worse than another dose of the narcotic, and
  under its spell he is spirited back to London, where, on arrival, he is
  confronted with the lady of his "dream," and <i>Mortimer John</i> secures
  a colossal fee. In addition, for he has had the happy thought of
  selecting his own daughter for the heroine, he secures a plutocrat for
  his son-in-law.</p>

  <p>The worst of a play in which one is conducted out of ordinary life
  into the regions of improbability by processes of which every step has to
  be just conceivably possible, is that the conscientious development of
  the scheme is apt to be tedious. And, frankly, the first scene or two,
  though lightened by expectation, were on the heavy side.</p>

  <p>But the film itself, when we got to it, was excellent fooling, and the
  reconstruction of the original drama at Dorking-in-the-Wild-West was
  really delightful. You can easily guess that Mr. CHARLES HAWTREY, as a
  cinema hero, very conscious of his heroism ("it's a way we have in
  Montague Square"), but always comfortably aware that in a dream, as he
  imagines it to be, he can well afford to make the handsomest of
  sacrifices, had a great chance. And he took it.</p>

  <p>As the heroine, who has to play a rather thankless part in the
  mercenary designs of her parent, Miss WINIFRED BARNES contrived, very
  naïvely and prettily, to preserve an air of maiden reluctance under the
  most discouraging conditions. As <i>Mortimer John</i> Mr. SYDNEY
  VALENTINE had admirable scope for his sound and businesslike methods. Of
  <i>Anthony's</i> relations, all very natural and human, Miss LYDIA
  BILBROOKE was an attractive figure, and the part of <i>Herbert
  Clatterby</i>, K.C., was played by Mr. EDMUND MAURICE with his accustomed
  ease of manner.</p>

  <p>If I wanted to find fault with any detail of the construction, it
  would be in the matter of the ring which <i>Anthony</i> places on the
  finger of <i>Aloney</i> in the cinema play. This was a spontaneous act
  not included in the scheme for which <i>Mortimer John</i> was given the
  credit. Yet as the means by which <i>Anthony</i> identified her on his
  return to consciousness it went far to bring that scheme to fruition. I
  think also that he ought to have shown some trace of surprise (I should
  myself) on finding that he had unconsciously exchanged his spotless
  evening clothes for the kit of a broncho-buster.</p>

  <p>I have hinted already at the comparative dulness of the long
  introduction to what is the <i>clou</i> of the play&mdash;the film and
  its reconstructed scenes. Why not take a further wrinkle from the
  cinematic drama and throw upon the screen a succinct résumé of the
  previous argument? Three or four minutes of steady application to the
  text, and we might plunge into the very heart of things. I throw out this
  suggestion not with any hope of reward, but in part payment of my debt
  for some very joyous laughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O.S.</p>

      <p>The ways of the Hun comprehension elude,</p>

      <p>For, in spite of his cunning and forethought immense,</p>
      <p>He is often incurably stupid and dense</p>

      <p>Now the pride of the Germans, as dear as their pipe</p>

  my difficulties. It's this getting £100 by paying only £95 that's
  knocking me sideways; and then there's the income tax, and the other loan
  at four per cent., on which no income tax is to be charged, and the
  conversion of the old four-and-a-half per cent. War Loan, and of the
  various lots of Exchequer Bonds. It's all as generous as it can be, but
  for a man whose mathematical education has been, shall we say, defective,
  it's as bad as a barbed-wire entanglement."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't muddle your unfortunate head any more. Just plank down your
  money and take what they give you. That's my motto."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," I said; "that's all very well for you. You aren't the head
  of the household, with all its cares depending on you. Heads of
  households ought-to know their exact position."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, heads of households ought to have learnt their arithmetic
  better and remembered more of it. The children and I haven't allowed
  ourselves to be hindered by little obstacles of that kind."</p>

  <p>"What," I said, "are you and the children in it too?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, we're all in it. I've put in the spare money from the
  housekeeping&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I always knew you got too much."</p>

  <p>"And the children have chipped in with their savings."</p>

  <p>"Savings?" I said. "How have they got any savings?"</p>

  <p>"Presents from affectionate godmothers and aunts, which were put into
  the Post Office Savings Bank. They're all out now and into the
  Loan&mdash;all, that is, except Frederick's little all."</p>

  <p>"And what's happened to that?"</p>

  <p>"That's put into War Certificates. It was his own idea. He was
  fascinated by the poster, and insisted that his money should go in the
  purchase of cartridges, so there it is."</p>

  <p>"And at the end of five years he'll get back £1 for every 15<i>s.</i>
  6<i>d.</i> he's put in."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he'll get £5. He made a lot of difficulty about that."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say he jibbed about getting his money back?"</p>

  <p>"That's precisely what did happen. He said he'd <i>given</i> the money
  for cartridge buying, and how could he take it back with a bit extra
  after the cartridges had been bought. He's really rather annoyed about
  it."</p>

  <p>"I shall tell him," I said, "not to let it worry him, and shall
  explain to him how much <i>per cent.</i> he's getting <i>per
  annum</i>."</p>

  <p>"You'll have to work it out yourself first of all," she said, "and I
  know you can't do that. And, by the way, you may as well be ready for
  him; he's going to ask you if he may join the Army as a drummer-boy."</p>

  <p>"What on earth's put that into his head?"</p>

  <p>"He's been talking to the Sergeant-Major, and he's invented a musical
  instrument of his own. It's made out of a cardboard box, some pins and
  two or three elastic bands. There it is&mdash;you'll find its name
  inscribed on it."</p>

  <p>I took it up and saw inscribed upon it in large pencilled letters this
  strange device: "THE TIPINBANOLA; made for soldiers only."</p>

  <p>"Francesca," I said, "it's a superb name. Where did he get it
  from?"</p>

  <p>"Out of his head," she said.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," I said, "if he keeps any arithmetic there?"</p>

  <p>"Ask him; I'm sure he'd be proud to help you."</p>

  <p>"No," I said, "I must plough my weary furrow alone."</p>

  <p>"And the guinea-hens," she said, "are still squawking."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "isn't it awful?"</p>

  <p>"I'll go and stop them," she said.</p>

  <p>"It's no good," I said, "I shan't hear them stop."</p>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</p>

  <p>Mr. S.P.B. MAIS, in a dedicatory letter to <i>Interlude</i> (CHAPMAN
  AND HALL), tells us that he has "simply tried to show what a man
  constituted like Shelley would have made of his life had he bean alive in
  1917." Without any doubt his attempt has succeeded. I am, however, bound
  to add this warning (if Mr. MAIS'S is not enough), that a novel with such
  a purpose is not, and could not be, milk for babes. Nothing that I had
  previously read of Mr. MAIS'S had prepared me for the proficiency he
  shows here. Obviously attached to the modern school of novelists, he has
  many of its faults and more of its virtues. One may accept his main point
  of view, yet be offended sometimes by his details. But the fact remains
  that in <i>Geoffrey Battersby</i> he has given us a piece of
  character-drawing almost flawlessly perfect. Not for a very long time has
  it been my good fortune to attend such a triumph, and I wish to proclaim
  it. The women by whom <i>Geoffrey</i>, the weak and the wayward, was
  attracted hither and thither are also well drawn; but here Mr. MAIS shows
  his present limitations. Nevertheless I feel sure that he has within him
  the qualities that go to make a great novelist, and that if he will free
  himself from certain marked prejudices his future lies straight and clear
  before him.</p>

  <p>It was a happy idea of the Sisters MARY and JANE FINDLATER to call
  their new book of short stories <i>Seen and Heard</i> (SMITH, ELDER),
  with the sub-title, <i>Before and After 1914</i>. I say short stories,
  but actually these have so far outgrown the term that a half-dozen of
  them make up the volume. They are all examples of the same gentle and
  painstaking craft that their writers have before now exhibited elsewhere.
  Here are no sensational happenings; the drama of the tales is wholly
  emotional. My own favourites are the first, called "The Little Tinker," a
  half-ironical study of the temptation of a tramp mother to surrender her
  child to the blessings of civilisation; and how, by the intervention of a
  terrible old woman, the queen of the tribe, this momentary weakness was
  overcome. My other choice, the last tale in the collection (and the only
  one contributed by Miss MARY FINDLATER), is a dour little comedy of the
  regeneration, through poverty and hard work, of two underemployed and
  unpleasant elderly ladies. A restful book, such as will keep no one awake
  at nights, but will give pleasure to all who appreciate slight studies of
  ordinary life sketched with precise and careful finish.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Their Lives</i> (STANLEY PAUL) has at least this point of
  originality, that it ends with the wedding of somebody other than the
  heroine, or rather, I should say, the chief heroine, because, strictly
  speaking, all three daughters of <i>Mr.</i> and <i>Mrs. Radmall</i> might
  be said jointly to fill this post, but it is <i>Christina</i>, the
  eldest, who fills most of it. The other two were named <i>Virgilia</i>
  and <i>Orinthia</i>, and I can't say that these horrific labels did them
  any injustice. As for the story of "their lives," as VIOLET HUNT tells
  it, there is really nothing very much to charm in a history of three
  disagreeable children developing into detestable young women. Perhaps it
  may have some value as a study of feminine adolescence, but I defy anyone
  to call the result attractive. Its chief incident, which is (not to mince
  matters) the attempted seduction by <i>Christina</i> of a middle-aged
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>
  man, the father of one of her friends, mercifully comes to nothing. I
  like to believe that this sort of thing is as unusual as it is
  unpleasant. For the rest, the picture of the "artistic" household in
  which the children grew up, of their managing mother, and the slightly
  soured and disappointed painter their father, is drawn vividly enough.
  But what unamiable people they all are! "MILES IGNOTUS," who supplies a
  quaintly attractive little preface, in which he speaks of having read the
  book in proof under shell-fire, affects to discover in them a kinship
  with Prussia. Certainly they are almost frightful enough.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Having read all about <i>The Rise of Ledgar Dunstan</i> (DUCKWORTH)
  from obscurity to wealth, literary success and aristocratic wedlock, I
  should be infinitely content to leave him at that and have done; but Mr.
  ALFRED TRESIDDER SHEPPARD warns us that there is more to follow, and even
  hints that the sequel, opening in July, 1914, may in many respects be far
  indeed from the dulness of happily-ever-after. If <i>Ledgar</i> had been
  satisfied to marry the sweetheart of his school-days there might have
  been some danger of such a disaster; but, having put his humble past,
  including his Nonconformist conscience, too diligently behind him for
  that, he will have to face whatever his author and the KAISER may have in
  store, supported only by a wife who is going, I trust and believe, to
  revenge on him all the irritation which she and I both felt at his
  attitude of unemotional superiority towards all the world. Some people
  may think it almost a pity that the lady cannot deal similarly with Mr.
  SHEPPARD himself in just reprisal for his long-winded and nebulous way of
  talking about Anti-Christ and Armageddon, and for his revolting incidents
  of murder and insanity introduced without any excuse of necessity. The
  book contains a considerable element of lively if undiscriminating
  humour, but its insistence on the gruesome is so unfortunate that unless
  his hero's future fate be already irrevocably fixed in manuscript one
  would like to remind the author that essays in this kind are the easiest
  form of all literary effort and the least supportable.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>With Serbia into Exile</i> (MELROSE) is a book that will suffer
  little from the fact that its tragic tale has already been told by
  several other pens. Mr. FORTIER JONES, the writer, has much that is fresh
  to say, and a very fresh and vigorous way of saying it. His book and
  himself are both American of the best kind&mdash;which is to say,
  wonderfully resourceful, observant, sympathetic and alive. From a
  newspaper flung away by a stranger on the Broadway Express, Mr. JONES
  first became aware that men were wanted for relief work in Serbia, and
  "in an hour I had become part of the expedition." That is a phrase
  characteristic of the whole book. Though the matter of it is the story,
  "incredibly hideous and incredibly heroic," of a nation going into exile,
  Mr. JONES has always a keen eye for the picturesque and even humorous
  aspects of the tragedy; he has a quick sense of the effective which
  enables him to touch in many haunting pictures&mdash;the delusive peace
  of a sunny Autumn day among the Bosnian mountains; the face of KING PETER
  seen for a moment by lamplight amid a crowd of refugees; and countless
  others. More than a passing mention also is due to the many quite
  admirable snapshots with which the volume is illustrated. The author
  seems successfully to have communicated his own gifts of observation and
  selection to his camera, an instrument only too apt to betray those who
  look to it for support. One is glad for many reasons to think that our
  American cousins will read this book.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>The Man in the Fog</i> (HEATH, CRANTON) is a book that I find
  exceedingly hard to classify. Its author, Mr. HARRY TIGHE, has several
  previous stories to his credit, all of which seem to have moved the
  critics to pleasant sayings. But for my own part I have frankly to
  confess that I found <i>The Man in the Fog</i> somewhat wheezy company.
  The <i>Man</i> of the title was a kind of Northern Joseph, dismissed from
  a promising partnership with Potiphar after a domestic intrigue on the
  lines of the original. The fog happens when, years later, he meets the
  daughter of Mrs. Potiphar returning to her mother's house, and (at the
  risk of the poor girl catching her death) detains her on the front step
  with foggy allusions to the mysterious past. I may mention that his own
  conduct in the interval had been such as I can only regard as a
  lamentable relapse from the altitude of the earlier chapters. But it is
  all vastly serious&mdash;it would perhaps be unkind to say
  sententious&mdash;and wholly unruffled by the faintest suggestion of
  comedy. For which reason I should never be startled to learn that HARRY
  TIGHE was either youthful, Scotch, or female (or indeed, for that matter,
  all three). In any case I can only hope that he, or she, will not resent
  my parting advice to cultivate a somewhat lighter touch, and the
  selection of such words as come easily from the tongue. Some of the
  dialogue in the present book is painfully unhuman.</p>

  excellently suited for the purpose of carrying a season ticket, so that
  it shall be at once secure and easily accessible. The tailor has made a
  horizontal slit, about two-and-a-half inches wide, in the right side of
  the coat, and cunningly inserted a small rectangular bag or pouch of
  linen, the whole thing being strongly stitched and neatly finished off
  with a flap. It makes an admirable receptacle for a season ticket of
  ordinary dimensions, and I recommend this contrivance to those who may
  not be acquainted with it."</blockquote>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
